Little Matej is solving an OOP (Object-oriented programming) laboratory exercise and he’s having trouble with solving one subtask.

He is given a set that contains N words. He is also given Q queries where each query is one pattern. A pattern consists of a single character “*” and lowercase letters of the English alphabet. For example, “*”, “kul*to”, “ana*”.

A pattern is said to cover a word if such an array of letters (which can be empty) exists that, when replacing the character “*”, the pattern and the word become completely identical. It is necessary to output how many words each pattern covers.

Input
The first line of input contains two integers N and Q (1≤N,Q≤100000). Each of the following N lines contains a word that consists of lowercase letters of the English alphabet. Each of the following Q lines contains a pattern for which you need to output how many words from the first set it covers. The total number of characters will be less than 4000000.

Output
Output Q lines, the k-th line containing the number of words that the k-th pattern covers.
