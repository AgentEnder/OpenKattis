# Convex Polygon Area
## https://open.kattis.com/problems/convexpolygonarea

For this problem, you just need to be able to calculate the area of convex polygons.

Input
Input starts with an integer 1≤n≤100, indicating the number of convex polygons. The next n lines each contain one convex polygon description. Each begins with an integer 3≤m≤100 indicating the number of points in the polygon. Following this are m pairs of integers, where each pair represents the x and y coordinates of a vertex. The bounds on the coordinates are −5000≤x,y≤5000. The vertices are given in counter-clockwise order, and no two vertices are the same. As is typical for a polygon, the last vertex is connected to the first one.

Output
For each polygon, output its area.
